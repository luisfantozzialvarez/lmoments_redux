# lmoments_redux
This repository stores code for the Monte Carlo exercises in "Inference in parametric models with many L-moments". The scripts gev.R and gpd.R replicate, respectively, exercises using a Generalised Exponential and Generalised Pareto distribution. The remaining codes contain auxiliary functions to these exercises.
